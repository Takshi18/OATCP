This code calculates the sum of Hamming distances between all pairs of integers in the given array nums. The Hamming distance between two integers is defined as the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

###Approach used:

##Nested Loops: The code uses two nested loops to iterate over all pairs of integers in the array nums. The outer loop iterates over each integer in the array, and the inner loop iterates over all integers following the current integer in the array.

##Bitwise XOR Operation: For each pair of integers (nums[i], nums[j]), the code calculates the bitwise XOR (^) of the two integers.xor operator to know the difference in bits inside nested for loops

##The code then uses __builtin_popcount function to count the number of set bits (bits with value 1) in the result

##The count of set bits in the result of the XOR operation for each pair of integers is added to the total count cnt.

##Finally, the total count of Hamming distances between all pairs of integers in the array nums is returned
