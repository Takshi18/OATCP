This code solves the problem of counting the number of subgrids in an \(N \times N\) grid where all four corners are black (marked as 1). Here's an explanation of the approach:

### Preprocessing the Grid:
The function `preprocess_grid` converts the input grid into a more compact representation suitable for efficient bitwise operations. 

- It initializes a vector `processed_grid` with a size that can accommodate the number of rows in the grid.
- For each cell in the grid where the value is 1 (black square), it sets the corresponding bit in `processed_grid` to 1. This is done using bitwise OR (`|`) operation and left shift (`<<`) to set the appropriate bit.
- The grid is processed row by row, with each row of the grid being represented by a sequence of bits in the `processed_grid`. 

### Counting Subgrids:
The function `count_subgrid` iterates over all pairs of rows in the processed grid and counts the number of common set bits between them. 

- For each pair of rows `a` and `b`, it performs a bitwise AND (`&`) operation between the corresponding rows in the processed grid.
- It then uses `__builtin_popcount` (which counts the number of set bits in an integer) to count the common set bits between the two rows.
- It accumulates the counts of common set bits for all pairs of rows, which represent the number of subgrids where the corresponding rows have all corners black.
- Finally, it calculates the total number of subgrids by summing up the contributions from all pairs of rows.

### Main Function:
- The main function reads the size of the grid (`n`) and the elements of the grid from the input.
- It preprocesses the grid using `preprocess_grid` and counts the number of subgrids using `count_subgrid`.
- Finally, it prints the result.

This approach efficiently handles large grids by using bitwise operations to represent and manipulate the grid data. It counts the number of subgrids with all corners black by iterating over pairs of rows and counting the common set bits between them.
