This code finds the number of ways to reach the bottom-right cell of a grid, moving only right or down, while avoiding blocked cells. It uses dynamic programming to store the number of ways to reach each cell efficiently. The user provides the size of the grid and the grid itself, where '.' represents empty cells and '*' represents blocked cells. Then, it calculates and displays the result.
